I've been thinking about diving into parallel programming. No matter what new AI technology I learn, whether it's the latest LLM models or techniques like flash attention to speed up inference, I keep circling back to the same thought: How do I train and implement this efficiently using CUDA code? Do I have the necessary technology to train it on multiple GPUs, whether on the cloud or a local machine? So, I've made up my mind to delve into the internals of GPU workings and finally understand this black box. In this series of blogs,I will document my journey of learning how to program this parallel processor and effectively utilize its capabilities
