Before we dive in, I want to make it clear that the concept I'm about to discuss is not entirely my own. It's more of a synthesis of what I've learned and explored regarding the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an Operating System. My inspiration comes from various papers and projects in the field.

Have you ever seen the movie "Her"? It's an intriguing story where the protagonist forms a deep bond with an operating system that interacts with him in an incredibly human-like manner. We used to believe that developing such a system would take decades, but recent advancements in language modeling have brought us closer to that reality than ever before. Language Models, such as GPT-4 and Claude 2, have completely transformed the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). But here's the really exciting part: their potential extends far beyond NLP. These models boast incredible capabilities, such as reasoning, accessing APIs, and breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks that they can solve one by one.

Thanks to these remarkable abilities, some believe (Andrej Kapathy) that Language Models could serve as the foundation for a modern operating system, essentially becoming the kernel of a new era of software. A one step towards the AGI.

Just imagine having an operating system that understands your natural language commands, assists you with tasks, and adapts to your needs. It would be like having a personal assistant who can handle complex requests and make your life a whole lot easier.

With Language Models at the core of an operating system, we could interact with our devices in a much more intuitive and interactive manner. We could simply speak or type our commands, and the system would seamlessly understand and execute them. Tasks that currently require multiple applications or manual steps could be streamlined into a single, unified experience. Need to book a flight? Just ask your operating system, and it will take care of all the details. Want to schedule a meeting? Your operating system will find the best time for everyone and send out the invites. The potential of Language Models as an operating system is genuinely exciting. It opens up a world of possibilities for enhancing productivity, simplifying complex tasks, and creating a more seamless and natural user experience.

As we continue to push the boundaries of language modeling, we are moving closer to a future where our operating systems become intelligent companions, capable of understanding and assisting us in ways we never thought possible.
